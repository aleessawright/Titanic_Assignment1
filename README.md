# Titanic_Assignment1
The first assignment of Introduction to Data Science

My partner Jisoo and I identified patterns in data about passengers from the Titanic. 
This data concerned demographics such as class, gender, and more.
We found relationships between this data to each passenger's survival.

To visualize these relationships, I used the ggplot2 package to plot graphs.
